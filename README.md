# List of ICPC India Contests

ICPC India 2021-22 is knocking at the door. So, inspired by similar blogs on Codeforces for [Open Cup](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/84466), [Petrozavodsk Camp](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/84489), and [USACO](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/95032), and also due to the fact [ICPC Live Archive](https://icpcarchive.ecs.baylor.edu/) collapsed, I decided to list down all ICPC contests of India I could find. 

Please note that this blog contains only the materials and links I could find. Also, since I am not a native English speaker, apologies for any grammatical errors. I hope this is of some help to you guys.

|[Kanpur First Round Online](https://icpc.global/regionals/finder/Kanpur-Preliminary-2010)| [Codechef](https://www.codechef.com/ACMKAN10) | [Problems](https://github.com/m-e-r-l-i-n/icpc-india/blob/main/src/2010problemset_kanpur_online.pdf) [Editorial](https://www.codechef.com/wiki/october-cookoff-contest-problem-editorials)|

The editorial links to discussions on Codechef as well. <br>
Kanpur Site also organized a warm-up contest, it can be upsolved [here](https://www.codechef.com/COOK03). 



### ICPC 2009-10
| Contest | Upsolving | Materials |
|-|-|-|
| [Amritapuri Regional](https://icpc.global/regionals/finder/Amritapuri-2009) | [Baekjoon](https://www.acmicpc.net/category/detail/1540) | [Problems](https://github.com/m-e-r-l-i-n/icpc-india/blob/main/src/amrita2009problems.pdf) |
| [Gwalior-Kanpur Regional](https://icpc.global/regionals/finder/Gwalior-Kanpur-2009) | &nbsp; | [Problems](https://github.com/m-e-r-l-i-n/icpc-india/blob/main/src/PROBLEMS2009kanpur.pdf) [Website](https://www.cse.iitk.ac.in/users/acm/archive/acm2009/index.html)|

Please note the baekjoon link does not have all the problems. They might be added in future.<br>
Also, I could not find the actual problemset used in Amritapuri regional. So I merged the problems in the order they appeared in the contest from [vjudge](https://vjudge.net/). 

### ICPC 2008-09
| Contest | Upsolving | Materials |
|-|-|-|
|[Amritapuri Regional](https://icpc.global/regionals/finder/Amritapuri-2008/standings)| &nbsp; | [Problems](https://github.com/m-e-r-l-i-n/icpc-india/blob/main/src/problems_amritapuri_2008.pdf) [Website](https://icpc.amrita.ac.in/2008/index2008.php) |
|[Kanpur Regional](https://icpc.global/regionals/finder/Kanpur-2008/standings)| &nbsp; | [Problems](https://github.com/m-e-r-l-i-n/icpc-india/blob/main/src/problems_kanpur_2008.pdf) [Website](https://www.cse.iitk.ac.in/users/acm/archive/acm2008/index.html) |

Not sure if the websites are well maintained. They can be down anytime. Amritapuri's website mentioned we could practice the problems at ICPC live archive, so maybe we could have upsolved there.<br>
A few of these problems might be available on SPOJ. Try searching by problem names.

### ICPC 2006-07

| Contest | Upsolving | Materials |
|-|-|-|
| [Coimbatore Regional](https://icpc.amrita.ac.in/2006/) | &nbsp; | [Problems](https://github.com/m-e-r-l-i-n/icpc-india/blob/main/src/amrita2006-07problems.pdf) |



<br><br>
With ICPC Live Archive down, and resources limited, I could not find a lot of resources of older contests.

Concluding notes:<br>
<ul>
<li>In case there is any error, or I have missed out on anything, or there exist better alternatives, feel free to suggest in the comments.</li>
<li>A lot of material in this blog have been taken from <a href="https://www.codechef.com/icpc">Codechef</a>. Kudos to them.</li> 
<li>I have linked most of the contests to the <a href="https://icpc.global/">ICPC Site</a>. It contains standings, problems, reports and also the local website links (some links might not work, I have added as many as I could find, maybe googling will help). Explore around to find all details.</li> 
<li>Good team contests in India are rare, so I had a (far fetched) idea of making a <a href="https://codeforces.com/groups">CF group</a> which contained all Indian ICPC contests so that teams could participate and train themselves. However, I don't think I alone can do that. I hope Indian ICPC Committee (not sure if there exists any) considers about doing something similar in future.</li>
</ul>
